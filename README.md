Senior engineering projects for Atrium. Scarlett, Karlin, Caroline, Marisol. 

First visit to the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center in Charlotte was 10/26. 
  We toured their assistive technology lab and were able to see a lot of the current devices they are using. Then we took a tour of their gym on the first floor and met one of their patients "Jordan," a 23 year old male who has issues walking and tremors due to a stroke, and we were able to see him practice walking across the gym with a walker. We then toured the gym on the spinal and brain trauma floor and met a 21 year old we call "Shaq" whose spinal cord was severed after he was shot in the back. We discussed with the nurses what kinds of devices they were already using and what needed to be improved.
